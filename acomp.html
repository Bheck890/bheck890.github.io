      <h3 class="center">Java Code</h3>
      <p>
        My first program was a calculator using strings and converting diffrent data types<br>
        just to start, figureing out what to do<br>
        In my second program I programed Retro games:<br>
        Like, Snake, Space invaders, and working on brick breaker on my spare time<br>
      </p>
      <h3 class="center">Built Computers</h3>
      <p>
        I Built my own computer (<em>link Below</em>)<br>
        Also Built my moms computer, and helped build a few of my friends,<br>
        as well as built and tested computers in highschool and work<br>
        <br>
        I am the person my friends and family talk to,to fix and upgrade their computers!<br>
        My First Build<br>

      <h3 class="center">Long boards *NEW*</h3>
      <p>
        Long boards are nice to ride, so I started to take the skateboards apart and leared about all the diffrent parts<br>
        then I got all the parts and put my board together, And had a little too much fun and made four of them. (Yikes)<br>

      <h3 class="center">Java Code</h3>
      <p>
        Working on a system to use SQL databases of events and analyze data and spit back averages (Mainly for Dorm laundry)<br>
        After working on those skills with the SQL I am going to work on my own quick books as I use excel to budget my money<br>
      </p>
      <h3 class="center">Building Computers NEED MONEY</h3>
      <p>
        I want to create two powerful computers, because why not,<br>
        One for the living room as a hub Computer, to play video games with friends, and stuff<br>
        The second would be the Thread Ripper CPU for the cores to do VM's and programing eventually AI.<br>
        Also the CPU looks freaking awsome<br>
