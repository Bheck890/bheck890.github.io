      <h3 class="center">Java Code</h3>
      <p>
        My first program was a calculator using strings and converting diffrent data types<br>
        just to start, figureing out what to do<br>
        In my second program I programed Retro games:<br>
        Like, Snake, Space invaders, and working on brick breaker on my spare time<br>
      </p>
      <h3 class="center">Built Computers</h3>
      <p>
        I Built my own computer (<em>link Below</em>)<br>
        Also Built my moms computer, and helped build a few of my friends,<br>
        as well as built and tested computers in High School and work<br>
        <br>
        I am the person my friends and family go to, to solve their computer problems<br>
        and upgrade with hardware and software.<br>
        My First Build<br>

      <h3 class="center">Long boards</h3>
      <p>
        Long boards are nice to ride, so I started to take the skateboards apart and leared about all the diffrent parts<br>
        then I got all the parts and put my board together, And had a little too much fun and made four of them. (Yikes)<br>

      <h3 class="center">Java Code</h3>
      <p>
        Working on a system to use SQL databases of events, and analyze data and gather Statistics for Fun<br>
        After working on those skills with the SQL, I am going to work on my own quick books as I use excel to budget my money<br>
      </p>
      <h3 class="center">Building Computers</h3>
      <p>
        I have built computers and hope to build more. Some of the computers I have built are for my familly and my self<br>
        One for the living room as a hub Computer, to play video games with friends, and stuff<br>
        The second would be the Thread Ripper CPU for the cores to do VM's and programing eventually AI.<br>
        Also the CPU looks freaking awsome<br>
